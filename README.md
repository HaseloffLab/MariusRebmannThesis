Support materials for Marius Rebmann's PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge

## single cell RNA sequencing analysis

The scipts in the `scRNA-seq` folder contain notebooks for the analysis of the single cell RNA-seq dataset described in  __Sections 2.4.3-2.4.9__ of the thesis.

## public RNA-seq analysis

The `public-RNA-seq` folder contains scripts for the analysis of public RNA-sequencing data described in __Section 2.4.2.__ and used for __Fig. 6.8__. The data has been published at [ACS Synth. Biol.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00511).  

## Image analysis

The  `Image-analysis` folder contains the script used to quantify fluorescence for __Fig. 6.9__. 

## Loop assembly parts

The `plasmid-maps` folder contains the plasmid sequences described in the __Section 2.1__ of the thesis.

The plasmid maps can be viewed at [Benchling](https://benchling.com/mariusrebmann/f_/aVSKR2za-thesis_marius_rebmann/)
